# Shell
Wrote a command line interpreter (a shell) that takes commands from standard input and executes the commands by creating processes.

Most of the Unix shell features are covered, namely some:
1. File redirection
2. Pipes
3. Signals - SIGINT, SIGTSTP, SIGCHLD
4. Job Control (implement jobs)
5. Backgrounding, Foregrounding with jobid as well as pid
6. Checking of Path Variable
